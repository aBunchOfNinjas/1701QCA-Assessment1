### Experiment name ###

Experement 1 pressing button a to trigger the led screen.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was that the micro bit has external pins that are for the buttons, this is very useful as the microbit codeing builder is set up to make useing the A & B buttons a bit easier than using any other. This may be helpful in later projects.The basis of this experement is just to use some buttons but it also introduces us to the bread board and how that works.  

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as ANY BUTTON ANYWHERE. 

### Experiment name ###

2. Using a Light Sensor & Analog Inputs

Shining light on phototransister to display sun on led display.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was logic in code. This experement introduced us to digital logic and how to use it in the make code editor. As the editor is its own type of language learning the intricusys of how logic is used in the editor is quite important to get the most functionality out of the microbit. I will also be needed in later projects most likely.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as in your phone! What? Yes when your phone is on its screen and you flip it over and it atomaticaly lights up this is the result of a phototransistor.

### Experiment name ###

3. Dimming an LED Using a Potentiometer.
