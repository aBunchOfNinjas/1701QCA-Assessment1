(Experement 1 pressing button a to trigger the led screen.)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was that the micro bit has external pins that are for the buttons, this is very useful as the microbit codeing builder is set up to make useing the A & B buttons a bit easier than using any other. This may be helpful in later projects.The basis of this experement is just to use some buttons but it also introduces us to the bread board and how that works.  

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as ANY BUTTON ANYWHERE.
